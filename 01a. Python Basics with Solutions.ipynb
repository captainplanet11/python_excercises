    "#### What are notebooks? \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Analytics notebooks allow Data Scientists to quickly build models and visualize their data distribution, realize experiments and test different scenarios all in the same environment. The structure provided by notebooks helps in the development of analytics models and has become the standard tool for model development within the Data Science community. The first notebook interfaces emerged in the late 1980s with the release of Wolfram Mathematica 1.0 on the Macintosh. Later, MATLAB also introduced an user-friendly interface for scientifc computing in the notebook format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook platforms provide an \"all-in-one\" experience to the user, as they synthesize structures for coding, data visualization, and data manipulation in a unique framework. A notebook is therefore an interactive report with all the information an analyst needs: the script, the results of the script, the visualization of the results and the capability to write text/equations and communicate ideas and conclusions through them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An overview of Zeppelin notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Apache Zeppelin was developed in 2013 by the Apache Foundation as part of the Hadoop landscape. It?s well suited for working with distributed data accross the Hadoop ecosystem. With Zeppelin, it is possible to create dashboards and integrate them with Hadoop applications (Spark, Pig, Hive, etc.). One of Zeppelin?s advantage is the possibility to combine multiple paragraphs in a single line and it also allows the user to mix different languages across the cells (some languages supported by Zeppelin are Scala - with Spark, Python - with Spark, SparkSQL, Hive, Markdown and Shell). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will use Zeppelin notebooks within Analytics Workbench to explore different datasets and learn rapidly from them. The notebooks are at the core of the learning process as they provide an aesthetically pleasing enviroment to work with and allow quick data manipulation and visualization. "

    "Python was developed by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991, with the philosophy of being an easy-to-read language. It is a high-level, general-purpose programming language and features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It supports both functional and object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms. It has become very popular and has a very large toolbox, facilitating the solution to many problems. It is also a very attractive language for Machine Learning, as we will see along this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Python?\n",
    "There are lots of open source software projects for Data Scientists, so why choose Python? Python has its heritage in the scientific and technical computing domains and presents a compact syntax. The latter making for a relatively easy language to learn while the former means it scales to offer good performance with massive data volumes. This is one of the reasons why Google uses it so extensively and has even developed an outstanding tutorial for programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons as to why Python is so popular in the Machine Learning community. It has become the default language for Machine Learning during the last years. The syntax is one of the key elements, as it is elegant and \"math-like\", that is, the semantics are quite similar to the way mathematicians would think about modeling a problem. Thus, it is very intuitive, especially for those working on projects closer to scientific computing. Because it is viewed as the standard language in the area, the online community is large, which builds Python's popularity even more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major reason is the number of very attractive machine learning libraries. Basically, one can find a package to almost anything, including: image processing; text mining; Machine Learning (in various formats); data wrangling; data cleansing; deep learning; scientific computing; statistics; In this section we will explore the basics of the language and see why it is considered an easy-to-code, easy-to-read and versatile tool."
