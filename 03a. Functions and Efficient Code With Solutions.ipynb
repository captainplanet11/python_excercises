    "#### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In the pre-work (Lecture 0 and Homework 0) we saw some of the fundamental building blocks of the Python language. We explored `for` and `while` loops, Python's different data types, and its basic syntax. However, when writing a computer program, we wish to have a clean, concise and efficient sequence of commands. We can talk about \"style\" and define different programming styles. In general, each programming language is more associated to a programming style. For example, there's object-oriented programming (OOP) (e.g. Java, Ruby), logic programming (e.g. Prolog), imperative programming (e.g. C, Pascal, C++) and, of course, functional programming (Lisp, Clojure, Scala). Python is presented many times as an OOP language but it is so versatile that it can be classified as a multiparadigm language. Therefore, one can easily write code in a functional programming way using Python (in fact, Python can be used for both OOP and functional programming). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we define what a function is and explore its basic syntax. First, in a traditional sense (with some hands-on and basic examples). Later, we shift from a standard way of programming into a functional way, by utilizing many of Python's built-in functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python's functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is an organized, reusable code structure that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions also provide readibility for the code by defining a name to a given set of Python statements. In computer programming, functions are used to bundle a set of instructions to use repeatedly. A function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task. To carry out that specific task, the function might or might not need multiple inputs. In Python, there are three types of functions: (a) Built-in functions; (b) User-defined functions; (c) Anonymous functions (lambda functions). We have already seen some built-in functions in Python: \n",

    "### Functional Programming Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python's built-in functions, list comprehensions and good programming practices\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a wide range of built-in functions. The complete list can be seen in the following reference: \n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on the most useful ones, which are good to simplify and reduce the complexity of many Python algorithms. Namely, we will explore the following:\n",
    "````\n",
    "lambda(), map(), filter(), zip(), enumerate()\n",
    "````\n",
    "A `lambda()` function is an anonymous Python function. It allows the creation of functions in a single statement. A `lambda()` function is usually associated with another built-in function (`map()`, `filter()`, etc.) and simplifies several lines of Python code into a single line. These types of functions constitute the basic structure of what is known as <b>functional programming</b>. In this section we explore the usage of these Python resources. We also explore <b>list comprehensions</b> in this module and compare it with some built-in functions as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functional Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's the functional programming paradigm? According to David Mertz, in his short book \"Functional Programming in Python\"[1], it is a style which encompasses - among other things - some of the following characteristics: functions are first class (objects); Recursion is used as a primary control structure. In some languages, no other loop construct exists; Focus on list processing. Lists are often used with recursion on sublists as a substitute for loops; <b>What</b> is computed is more important than <b>how</b> something is computed; Functional programming very often utilizes higher order functions (i.e., functions that operate on functions that operate on functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "And why should we use it? The development velocity of an application is somewhat faster and in general it has less bugs associated with the code itself. For those more academically inclined, the meaning of function in mathematics is more closely related to the functional programming style than it is in imperative programming. Loops are also avoided in functional programming and recursion is preferred instead. In recursive functions, the function repeatedly calls itself as a sub-function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important characteristic of Python's functional programming paradigm is its \"purity\". Consider the following code, for example: \n",
    "````\n",
    "def sum(some_list): \n",
    "    res = 0\n",
    "    for item in some_list: \n",
    "        res += item\n",
    "    return res\n",
    "````\n",
    "This is equivalent to simply write: \n",
    "````\n",
    "sum(some_list)\n",
    "````\n",
    "In a similar way, the built-in functions such as `map` and `filter` drastically reduce several lines of Python code into a single line and avoids some side-effects that more complicated scripts might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some downsides? \n",
    "\n",
    "The creator of Python - Guido van Rossum - dislikes the functional programming paradigm in Python, because most of the time it revolves around generating lists and there is already a standard way of doing that. According to the Zen of Python (remember Lecture 0!) \"There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it.\". In a way, we can say that functional programming isn't \"Pythonic\". A `map` and a `filter` can do the same thing as a list comprehension.\n",
