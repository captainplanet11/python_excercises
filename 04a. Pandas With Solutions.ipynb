    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use **open source Python package for data management**, built on top of the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The word <i>pandas</i> is a creative abbreviation for Python Data Analysis Library.  The name derives from the term \"panel data\", used in econometrics to describe observations related to the same individuals over different periods of time. It was developed by Wes McKinney in 2008.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is one of the most important tools currently being used in data science applications, particularly *data wrangling*. It contains useful functions for all aspects of  **data manipulation** and is widely used for **reading data, modifying data (data wrangling and cleansing), data analysis and writing data... basically everything with data** as it provides high-performance and easy-to-use pre-written functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is built on top of the 'NumPy' package, meaning a lot of the structure of NumPy is used or replicated in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed plotting functions from `Matplotlib`, and machine learning algorithms in `Scikit-learn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of data structures that are created in Pandas: <i>Series</i> and <i>DataFrames</i> (We will see their difference in the paragraphs below).  By creating these data structures with rows and columns, the data becomes much easier to work with.\n",
